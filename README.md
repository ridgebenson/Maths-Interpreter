# ðŸ§® Maths Interpreter and Line Generator ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the Maths Interpreter and Line Generator! This program, developed in C#, is a powerful tool that combines the power of mathematical computation with visual representation. It consists of two main parts:

1. ðŸ“š **Interpreter**: This component allows you to input mathematical expressions. The program then interprets these expressions and performs the necessary computations to output the results. It's like having a calculator that understands your language!

2. ðŸŽ¨ **GUI**: This part of the program draws a line based on the intercept and slope provided by the user. It's a great way to visualize linear equations and understand their behavior!

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
