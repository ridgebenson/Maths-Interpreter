# Maths Interpreter and Line Generator
Developed in C#, the program consists of two parts:
1. an interpreter
2. a GUI
## Functionality
The interpreter allows you to input mathematical expressions, and the program then interprets the mathematical expression and does mathematical computations to output the results.
The GUI draws a line after the user provides an intercept and a slope.
